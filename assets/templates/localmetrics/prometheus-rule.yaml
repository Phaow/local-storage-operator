          description: |
            Local Storage Operator disk-manager DaemonSet does not have any scheduled replicas.
            This DaemonSet handles LocalVolume and LocalVolumeSet objects and creates
            PersistentVolumes (PVs) for devices described in these objects. As result, Local
            Storage Operator is not able to create the PVs.
            Please check all LocalVolume and LocalVolumeSet objects and make sure that they have
            correct "nodeSelector" and "tolerations" fields, and there are nodes that match the
            nodeSelector and all taints of the matching nodes are tolerated.
            A frequent issue is that nodes that run OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) are tainted,
            so only ODF runs on these nodes. In that case, LocalVolume / LocalVolumeSet objects
            must tolerate such a taint to provide disks for ODF on the nodes.
